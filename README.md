This project was made as part of the "The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery" course on Udemy.
The intention was to build a face recognition application made with React.

How it works: 

1. Register to the website.
2. Grab a link that contains a picture.
3. Hit submit! 

The application will call the 'Face Detection' API made by Clarifai. If there's a face in the picture, the API will return the coordinates that are going to be used to draw a box around the face area.

You can find the final result by clicking this link: https://appsmartbrain.herokuapp.com/.
